# DiscordBackup
Simple Python scripts for backing up Discord servers.

Usage for now:

```
python3 backup.py <guild_id> <output_file_name>
```
or
```
python3 live.py <guild_id> [output_file_name]
```

You will need a file named token.txt which contains a bot or user token.
You may need to manually change `bot=False` to `bot=True` on line 64 of
`backup.py` and line 73 of `live.py`.

## Dependencies
You'll need `discord.py` rewrite and `sqlite3` to run these scripts. To
install these, run these commands:
```
$ sudo python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite
$ sudo python3 -m pip install sqlite3
```
or when using windows:
```
$ py -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite
$ py -m pip install sqlite3
```
