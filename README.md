# DiscordBackup
Simple Python scripts for backing up Discord servers.

Usage for now:

```
python3 backup.py <guild_id> <output_file_name>
```
or
```
python3 live.py <guild_id> [output_file_name]
```

You will need a file named token.txt which contains a bot or user token.
You may need to manually change `bot=False` to `bot=True` on line 64 of
`backup.py` and line 73 of `live.py`.

## Dependencies
You'll need `git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite` and `sqlite3` to run these scripts.
Install these as normal using pip. (`sudo pip install -U` on linux or `py -m pip install -U` on windows)

If you're running windows, you'll need to rename python3 to py and add sudo to your PATH.
